# ObscruinKnotting
My collaborators are interested in simulating the configuration of Obscurin's Ig domain and linker domain to determine if a random configuration would be "stretched" or "knotted" in on itself.
Using generated angles from a molecule simulation between the Ig domain and the linker domain, and then the linker domain and the next Ig domain, I used R to determine the appropriate distribution of the angles between these different domains for the purposes of building a Monte Carlo simulation in MATLAB. I discovered that the Ig to linker domain followed a normal distribution, whereas the linker to Ig domain followed a bimodal distribution. Using R to determine the average and standard deviation of these different distributions, I then built a MATLAB simulation code in 2D that would randomly select a starting point for the first Ig domain, select a random orientation angle, and knowing that the length of the Ig domain was between 32-34 Angstroms, consider the Ig domain to behave like a 2D vector and determine the termination location of the Ig domain. Then, the linker domain was assumed to start at the end of the Ig domain with an angle randomly generated from the normal distribution data. The linker domain is 12.8 Angstroms, so given the starting location in the Cartesian coordinate system, a randomly generated angle, I can calculate the end of the linker domain as a vector. I repeated this process for 18 nodes- an Ig domain and a linker domain make one node- then ran full Monte Carlo simulations 1,000,000 times. To determine if the portion of Obscurin was stretched out, I plotted the range of stretch in the x and y directions by calculating the difference in maximum x/y position from the minimum x/y positions for each simulation. These ranges were then plotted on histograms which demonstrate that it is highly unlikely that Obscurin is stretched.
